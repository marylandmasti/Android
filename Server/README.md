To set up the server you are going to have to install a couple of packages

This function was for windows so begin by getting python 3.7 and anaconda installed
Go into server.py and change the IP address there to your computer's IP address
 - hopefully the credentials file will allow you be me (Rohit) and access the google sheet i setup
 in the anaconda shell go to the folder and run "python server.py"
 - You should see "Thu Oct  3 19:16:50 2019 Server Starts - <YOUR_IP>:8080"
 Your computer will now be listening for HTTP requests
